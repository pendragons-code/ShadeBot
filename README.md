# ShadeBot
Another discord bot for someone I had to make!        
This is a custom bot, but I uploaded the code to github to show the bot is safe to add.


# How to use:
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/ShadeBot
cd ShadeBot
npm i
npm run deploy
```

# commands as of now:
Slash commands added, still no functional value

# notes
When you add the bot in the link, remember to choose the `application.commands` scope.
